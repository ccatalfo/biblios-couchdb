This is a plugin for the biblios (http://biblios.org) metadata editor.  It allows for displaying of records in and saving of records to a couchdb (http://couchdb.apache.org/) database.

To install, add the following to your biblios configuration file (biblios.xml):

<plugin>
  <name>CouchDb Network</name>
  <type>externalInterface</type>
  <file>plugins/bibliosCouch/bibliosCouch.js</file>
  <initcall></initcall>
  <enabled>1</enabled>
  <allowDelete>0</allowDelete>
  <allowModify>0</allowModify>
</plugin>

Copy the folder this file is contained in to your biblios/plugins directory, making sure that the path to bibliosCouch.js matches the path referenced in the above configuration file.

You need (obviously) a working couchdb installation.  To set this up for biblios, do the following:

1. Create a new database named "biblios".

2. Create a new view document with name "_design/records" to display all records
in couchdb.  This view should use this as the "all" view (to return all documents):
function(doc){emit(null,doc);}

3. In order to send requests to the couchDB installation, you'll need to setup a proxy like the following (for apache2 in this case):

 ProxyRequests Off
    <Proxy *>
        Order deny,allow
        Allow from all
    </Proxy>

    ProxyPass /couchdb http://localhost:5984
    ProxyPassReverse /couchdb http://localhost:5984
